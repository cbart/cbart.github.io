## I'm not lacking motivation, I'm lacking discipline

That is what [Natalie](https://www.youtube.com/@thenataliedawson) told me today via [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U-k-ruu8rQ).
It is not that I have not heard that before.
In my defense, before therapy I was going too fast to acknowledge that outside of being negative to myself.
During therapy on the other hand, the focus for me has been to listen to what is within.
_On the surface_ this does not vibe with discipline.
And for me it takes time to think more deeply.

Anywho, there is another funny story here that I would like to tell you.
When I asked my wife this evening whether I lack discipline she almost choked on the beverage she was enjoying.
Then she told me that yes, but that I can fix almost anything and that she is very proud of me.
This was nice, and indeed I just have fixed a water pump in our [hydroponic garden](https://mygardyn.com/).

Even more interesting than the video Natalie recorded was the comments section (as it often is).
There was a bunch of people that really confirmed something that struck a chord.
Once you get into a habit of doing things you do not want to, you become numb to the feeling.
People nodded to that.
Many people.

I am terribly afraid of pain and suffering that goes together with doing things I do not want to do (duh!)
But perhaps I can?
