title: "Accantus concert"

While waiting for the Accantus Live concert to start at the Stodoła club in Warsaw, I decided to start a blog.
I was inspired by a post on Hacker News about learning in public.
The idea is to write publicly available content every time I learn something new.

Why do this?

* I _believe_ in the [Petersonian argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfDOoADCfkg) that writing is an essential element of the thinking process.
  In other words, until I force myself to put a thought into words, I can't be sure what I specifically mean.
* Secondly, I think I might be able to build a habit that leads to regular self-reflection and... well-being?
  It reminds me a bit of the [Ignatian examen](https://www.jesuits.org/spirituality/the-ignatian-examen/), which I've never managed to keep up for more than a week.

10 minutes until the concert. Thank you, Gemini, for the blogging methodology and Copilot for inserting an example post.

P.S. Also thank you Gemini for translating the post, as one day later I decide to actually write in English.
